Description: Omixer - an Bioconductor package for multivariate and 
    reproducible randomization, which ensures optimal sample distribution 
    across batches with well-documented methods. It outputs lab-friendly 
    sample layouts, reducing the risk of sample mixups when manually pipetting 
    randomized samples.
